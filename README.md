# DPLS-demos

Numerical codes for CPAM paper on doubly-periodic Laplace and Stokes (DPLS)
in 2D. These demonstrate highly-accurate
numerical homogenization of a periodic geometry with one or many random smooth 
inclusions. This is solved for three settings:
potential-drop-driven Laplace Neumann (insulating inclusion) and
Dirichlet (conducting inclusion) BVPs,
and the pressure-drop-driven Stokes Dirichlet (no-slip velocity inclusion) BVP.
There are separate codebases for single-inclusion (dense direct solver) vs multi-inclusion (fast multipole based iterative solver).

Language: MATLAB (without any Toolboxes) / Octave. The multi-inclusion cases need FMMLIB2D (an older fortran library with MEX interfaces).

Authors: Gary Marple and Alex Barnett.  (C) 2017.

### Installation and testing

If you just want the single-inclusion codes, you can stop after the clone and start playing in the `singleinclusion` directory.
Otherwise, for the FMM-enabled multi-inclusion case, for a Linux/GCC system:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ahbarnett/DPLS-demos.git
cd DPLS-demos/fmmlib2d
make mwrap                     % C
make mex-matlab                % or mex-octave for Octave
make test-mex-matlab           % ditto. Should show small errors
cd ..
```
You will see that `fmmlib2d/matlab/fmm2d.mexa64` was built.
To test DPLS, start MATLAB and
```
cd multiinclusion_Laplace
setup
TestScript                        % will show the geometry
LaplaceSolver('Script')
PlotSolution('Script')
```
See the READMEs in the directories below for more details.

  * `multiinclusion_Laplace` - fast (FMM-based iterative) code for large-scale Laplace demos (by Marple)  
  * `multiinclusion_Stokes` - fast (FMM-based iterative) code for large-scale Stokes demos (by Marple)  
  * `fmmlib2d` - git submodule of 2D fast multipole method library of Gimbutas-Greengard  
  * `kdtree` - kd-tree implementation by Andrea Tagliasacchi, needed for geometry handling in multi-inclusion cases (a snapshot of [this](https://github.com/ataiya/kdtree))  

The demos are found in the first three directories; please follow the READMEs found therein.
