# DPLS-demos

Numerical codes for CPAM paper on doubly-periodic Laplace and Stokes (DPLS)
in 2D. These demonstrate highly-accurate
numerical homogenization of a periodic geometry with one or many random smooth 
inclusions. This is solved for three settings:
potential-drop-driven Laplace Neumann (insulating inclusion) and
Dirichlet (conducting inclusion) BVPs,
and the pressure-drop-driven Stokes Dirichlet (no-slip velocity inclusion) BVP.
There are separate codebases for single-inclusion (dense direct solver) vs multi-inclusion (fast multipole based iterative solver).

Language: MATLAB (without any Toolboxes) / Octave. The multi-inclusion cases need FMM2D (a fortran library with MEX interfaces) to be built.

Authors: Gary Marple and Alex Barnett.  (C) 2017.

### Installation and testing

If you just want the single-inclusion codes, you can stop after the first two lines here. The rest is for the more interesting multi-inclusion case:

```
git clone https://github.com/ahbarnett/DPLS-demos.git
cd DPLS-demos
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd fmm2d
```
Now follow [instructions](https://fmm2d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to compile `fmm2d` including its MATLAB/Octave interface. On Linux this means:
```
make matlab
```
Check that `lib-static/libfmm2d.a` and `matlab/fmm2d.mexa64` were built.
Now open MATLAB (at the directory `fmm2d`) and from there do
```
addpath matlab
rfmm2dTest
```
which should pass all tests in about 1 second.
To test DPLS now from MATLAB do
```
cd ../multiinclusion_Laplace
setup
TestScript                        % will show the geometry
LaplaceSolver('Script')
PlotSolution('Script')
```
See the READMEs in the directories below for more details.

  * `multiinclusion_Stokes` - fast (FMM-based iterative) code for large-scale Stokes demos (by Marple)  
  * `fmm2d` - git submodule of 2D fast multipole method library from the Flatiron Institute  
  * `kdtree` - kd-tree implementation by Andrea Tagliasacchi, needed for geometry handling in multi-inclusion cases (a snapshot of [this](https://github.com/ataiya/kdtree))  

The demos are found in the first three directories; please follow the READMEs found therein.
