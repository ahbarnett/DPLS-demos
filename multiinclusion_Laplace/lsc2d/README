Version 1.01

All codes are MATLAB. We have tested on MATLAB R2012a, and all
MATLAB usage is standard. We have not tested on octave; there may be
minor changes needed for that.
The main codes have documentation; the test drivers less so.
Please see accompanying preprint for explanation of use.
Use at your own risk; enjoy responsibly.

List of codes in this directory (Cauchy and Laplace codes are by Alex Barnett,
and Stokes codes are mostly by Bowei Wu). The figure and test codes are
useful to see examples of calling the evaluation codes. The code quadr.m is
generally useful for setting up curves from formulae or existing nodes:

  --- CAUCHY ---

cauchycompeval.m	: interior/exterior evaluation of analytic function
			  and its first derivative via trapezoid rule
			  applied to Cauchy integral formula, in
			  compensated 2nd-kind barycentric form.
fig_cauchycompeval.m	: test driver for cauchycompeval, makes convergence
			  figures (Fig. 3.1 in preprint).
quadr.m			: useful helper function to set up curve nodes, etc
goodbw.m		: helper containing new colorscale that becomes
			  linear grayscale when printed in black and white.

  --- LAPLACE ---

lapSevalclose.m		: single-layer potential evaluation and its gradient,
			  interior/exterior.
lapDevalclose.m		: double-layer potential evaluation and its gradient,
			  interior/exterior.
testlapSDevalclose.m    : test one of four Laplace BVPs using Nystrom method
			  and new potential & field evaluation scheme, showing
			  errors against the known solution.
tbl_lapconv.m		: test sup norm convergence for all 4 BVP types,
			  producing text output data (Table 4.1 in preprint).

  --- STOKES ---

StokesSevalclose.m	: single-layer potential evaluation, interior/exterior
StokesDevalclose.m	: double-layer potential evaluation, interior/exterior
testStokesSDevalclose.m : test one of four Stokes BVPs using Nystrom method
			  and new potential & field evaluation scheme, showing
			  errors against the known solution, and text output.
tbl_Stokesconv.m	: test sup norm convergence for all 4 BVP types,
			  producing text output data (Table 5.1 in preprint).
kernelS.m		: helper function for testStokesSDevalclose.m
quadratureS.m		: "
give_the_weights.m 	: "
regular_weights.m 	: "
sinterpS.m		: "
nodes_logx.dat		: "
nodes_regular.dat	: "
DmFT.m			: "

testall.m		: complete test suite, runs quadr('test'),
			  fig_cauchycompeval.m,
			  tbl_lapconv.m, and tbl_Stokesconv.m

----------------------

To do:

* Include Kress for Stokes SLP Nystrom self-matrix

* In Stokes, provide optional pressure output values at targets too.

* More examples of use in documentation. Checking of inputs, reporting errors.

* Switch to Helsing's exterior version, and try Trefethen's "interpolate the
  derivative" to bypass all messy barycentric-form derivs, delta, etc.

* Make beta an option in StokesDcloseeval.

* Make upsampling an option everywhere, to recover same acc as native in
  far-field ?

* split off utils like perispecdiff, fftinterp, diagind, circulant...?

* Fortran/C/OpenMP implementation for all, could be 10x faster

* Make octave-compatible.

* Put on github.


Version history:

1.01 10/8/14: quadr() split out from all codes, documented.
     	      Stokes interface changed to use s for curve, not y for nodes.
	      Found that int Neu Table 5.1 changed switching quadr to Z,Zp.
	      Removed spec_interp since fftinterp does it. AHB
1.0 10/7/14:  initial bundle. AHB
