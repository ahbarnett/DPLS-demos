Multi-inclusion doubly-periodic Laplace fast solver w/ Neumann BCs on
large number of random smooth inclusions (islands).

Language: MATLAB

By: Gary Marple and Alex Barnett.  (C) 2017.

This directory contains 3rd-party codes including:

lsc2d: Alex Barnett and Bowei Wu (hacked version)
inpoly: Darren Engwirda
gauss: Nick Trefethen

Requires: FMM2D and kdtree (both git submodules; please see ../README.md
for their installation).

Once in MATLAB, first run setup.m to configure the MATLAB path.

1) Running a single solution

To begin, open TestScript.m and edit the parameters as desired. Then,
run TestScript.m to generate a .mat file that contains the inclusion
positions and the parameter values that were decided on in
TestScript.m. To solve the 2D Neumann Laplace doubly-periodic BVP, run
LaplaceSolver.m using the name of the .mat file as its input. To view
a plot of the solution, run PlotSolution.m. To compute the flux
between the left and right sides of the domain, use SolutionFlux.m.

% Example (see driver.m)
>>setup  % sets up MATLAB path
>>TestScript
% Suppose TestScript generates the .mat file Script.mat
>>LaplaceSolver('Script')
% To compute the flux, run
>>SolutionFlux('Script')
% To plot the solution and its gradient magnitude, run
>>PlotSolution('Script')


2) Running a convergence study for fixed geometry

Edit the code driver_convergetest.m to your needs.
This code loops the above over a set of Nk (quadrature nodes per inclusion)
then plots the geometry and the convergence of estimated flux error.
