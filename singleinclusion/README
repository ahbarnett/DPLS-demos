Single-inclusion (dense linear algebra) figure- and table-generating
codes for doubly-periodic 2D Laplace and Stokes (DPLS) paper.

Language: MATLAB (tested on R2016b)

This is a snapshot of a subset of
[this repo](https://github.com/ahbarnett/BIE2D)

Please run setup.m to configure the MATLAB path before running any of the below.

There are six driver codes:

fig_lapQconv.m           : Laplace empty BVP convergence (Fig 2.1 ab)
fig_lapconvK1.m          : periodic Laplace BVP soln & flux conv (Fig 2.2 ace)
fig_stoQconv.m           : convergence of Laplace empty BVP solver (Fig 2.1 c)
fig_stoconvK1.m          : periodic Stokes BVP soln & flux conv (Fig 4.1 ac)
tbl_discarray_effcond.m  : square disc array Laplace conductivity, including
                           comparing against Helsing's solution (Table 3.1)
tbl_discarray_drag.m     : square disc array Stokes permeability (Table 4.1)

The fig_* codes are very quick to run (<1 to a couple of seconds).
The tbl_* codes take around 10-20 seconds.

To create EPS figures, make a figs/ directory and uncomment the figure
printing commands in the fig_* drivers above.

The code helsingeffcond.m is a slightly changed version of demo14b.m by Johan
Helsing.
